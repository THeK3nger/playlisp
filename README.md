# PlayLisP
## The PlayList Processor

**PlayLisP** is a playlist processor. It is a Python library that can be used to script playlist-generators. Shuffle, select 10 tracks from a playlist, mix it with another one, and produce a new playlist.

Actually it is just an experiment and works with *Spotify* only.
